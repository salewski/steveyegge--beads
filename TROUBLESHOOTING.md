## Installation Issues

### `bd: command not found`

bd is not in your PATH. Either:

```bash
# Check if installed
go list -f {{.Target}} github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd

# Add Go bin to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"

# Or reinstall
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

### `zsh: killed bd` or crashes on macOS

Some users report crashes when running `bd init` or other commands on macOS. This is typically caused by CGO/SQLite compatibility issues.

**Workaround:**
```bash
# Build with CGO enabled
CGO_ENABLED=1 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest

# Or if building from source
git clone https://github.com/steveyegge/beads
cd beads
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o bd ./cmd/bd
sudo mv bd /usr/local/bin/
```

If you installed via Homebrew, this shouldn't be necessary as the formula already enables CGO. If you're still seeing crashes with the Homebrew version, please [file an issue](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/issues).

## Database Issues

### `database is locked`

Another bd process is accessing the database, or SQLite didn't close properly. Solutions:

```bash
# Find and kill hanging processes
ps aux | grep bd
kill <pid>

# Remove lock files (safe if no bd processes running)
rm .beads/*.db-journal .beads/*.db-wal .beads/*.db-shm
```

**Note**: bd uses a pure Go SQLite driver (`modernc.org/sqlite`) for better portability. Under extreme concurrent load (100+ simultaneous operations), you may see "database is locked" errors. This is a known limitation of the pure Go implementation and does not affect normal usage. For very high concurrency scenarios, consider using the CGO-enabled driver or PostgreSQL (planned for future release).

### `bd init` fails with "directory not empty"

`.beads/` already exists. Options:

```bash
# Use existing database
bd list  # Should work if already initialized

# Or remove and reinitialize (DESTROYS DATA!)
rm -rf .beads/
bd init
```

### `failed to import: issue already exists`

You're trying to import issues that conflict with existing ones. Options:

```bash
# Skip existing issues (only import new ones)
bd import -i issues.jsonl --skip-existing

# Or clear database and re-import everything
rm .beads/*.db
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl
```

### Database corruption

**Important**: Distinguish between **logical consistency issues** (ID collisions, wrong prefixes) and **physical SQLite corruption**.

For **physical database corruption** (disk failures, power loss, filesystem errors):

```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 .beads/*.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# If corrupted, reimport from JSONL (source of truth in git)
mv .beads/*.db .beads/*.db.backup
bd init
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl
```

For **logical consistency issues** (ID collisions from branch merges, parallel workers):

```bash
# This is NOT corruption - use collision resolution instead
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl --resolve-collisions
```

See [FAQ](FAQ.md#whats-the-difference-between-sqlite-corruption-and-id-collisions) for the distinction.

### Multiple databases detected warning

If you see a warning about multiple `.beads` databases in the directory hierarchy:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ WARNING: 2 beads databases detected in directory hierarchy             ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Multiple databases can cause confusion and database pollution.          ║
║                                                                          ║
║ ▶ /path/to/project/.beads (15 issues)                                   ║
║   /path/to/parent/.beads (32 issues)                                    ║
║                                                                          ║
║ Currently using the closest database (▶). This is usually correct.      ║
║                                                                          ║
║ RECOMMENDED: Consolidate or remove unused databases to avoid confusion. ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

This means bd found multiple `.beads` directories in your directory hierarchy. The `▶` marker shows which database is actively being used (usually the closest one to your current directory).

**Why this matters:**
- Can cause confusion about which database contains your work
- Easy to accidentally work in the wrong database
- May lead to duplicate tracking of the same work

**Solutions:**

1. **If you have nested projects** (intentional):
   - This is fine! bd is designed to support this
   - Just be aware which database you're using
   - Set `BEADS_DB` environment variable if you want to override the default selection

2. **If you have accidental duplicates** (unintentional):
   - Decide which database to keep
   - Export issues from the unwanted database: `cd <unwanted-dir> && bd export -o backup.jsonl`
   - Remove the unwanted `.beads` directory: `rm -rf <unwanted-dir>/.beads`
   - Optionally import issues into the main database if needed

3. **Override database selection**:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily use specific database
   BEADS_DB=/path/to/.beads/issues.db bd list

   # Or add to shell config for permanent override
   export BEADS_DB=/path/to/.beads/issues.db
   ```

**Note**: The warning only appears when bd detects multiple databases. If you see this consistently and want to suppress it, you're using the correct database (marked with `▶`).

## Git and Sync Issues

### Git merge conflict in `issues.jsonl`

When both sides add issues, you'll get conflicts. Resolution:

1. Open `.beads/issues.jsonl`
2. Look for `<<<<<<< HEAD` markers
3. Most conflicts can be resolved by **keeping both sides**
4. Each line is independent unless IDs conflict
5. For same-ID conflicts, keep the newest (check `updated_at`)

Example resolution:
```bash
# After resolving conflicts manually
git add .beads/issues.jsonl
git commit
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl  # Sync to SQLite
```

See [TEXT_FORMATS.md](TEXT_FORMATS.md) for detailed merge strategies.

### ID collisions after branch merge

When merging branches where different issues were created with the same ID:

```bash
# Check for collisions
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl --dry-run

# Automatically resolve collisions
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl --resolve-collisions
```

See [ADVANCED.md#handling-import-collisions](ADVANCED.md#handling-import-collisions) for details.

### Permission denied on git hooks

Git hooks need execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout
```

Or use the installer: `cd examples/git-hooks && ./install.sh`

### Auto-sync not working

Check if auto-sync is enabled:

```bash
# Check if daemon is running
ps aux | grep "bd daemon"

# Manually export/import
bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl

# Install git hooks for guaranteed sync
cd examples/git-hooks && ./install.sh
```

If you disabled auto-sync with `--no-auto-flush` or `--no-auto-import`, remove those flags or use `bd sync` manually.

## Ready Work and Dependencies

### `bd ready` shows nothing but I have open issues

Those issues probably have open blockers. Check:

```bash
# See blocked issues
bd blocked

# Show dependency tree (default max depth: 50)
bd dep tree <issue-id>

# Limit tree depth to prevent deep traversals
bd dep tree <issue-id> --max-depth 10

# Remove blocking dependency if needed
bd dep remove <from-id> <to-id>
```

Remember: Only `blocks` dependencies affect ready work.

### Circular dependency errors

bd prevents dependency cycles, which break ready work detection. To fix:

```bash
# Detect all cycles
bd dep cycles

# Remove the dependency causing the cycle
bd dep remove <from-id> <to-id>

# Or redesign your dependency structure
```

### Dependencies not showing up

Check the dependency type:

```bash
# Show full issue details including dependencies
bd show <issue-id>

# Visualize the dependency tree
bd dep tree <issue-id>
```

Remember: Different dependency types have different meanings:
- `blocks` - Hard blocker, affects ready work
- `related` - Soft relationship, doesn't block
- `parent-child` - Hierarchical (child depends on parent)
- `discovered-from` - Work discovered during another issue

## Performance Issues

### Export/import is slow

For large databases (10k+ issues):

```bash
# Export only open issues
bd export --format=jsonl --status=open -o .beads/issues.jsonl

# Or filter by priority
bd export --format=jsonl --priority=0 --priority=1 -o critical.jsonl
```

Consider splitting large projects into multiple databases.

### Commands are slow

Check database size and consider compaction:

```bash
# Check database stats
bd stats

# Preview compaction candidates
bd compact --dry-run --all

# Compact old closed issues
bd compact --days 90
```

### Large JSONL files

If `.beads/issues.jsonl` is very large:

```bash
# Check file size
ls -lh .beads/issues.jsonl

# Remove old closed issues
bd compact --days 90

# Or split into multiple projects
cd ~/project/component1 && bd init --prefix comp1
cd ~/project/component2 && bd init --prefix comp2
```

## Agent-Specific Issues

### Agent creates duplicate issues

Agents may not realize an issue already exists. Prevention strategies:

- Have agents search first: `bd list --json | grep "title"`
- Use labels to mark auto-created issues: `bd create "..." -l auto-generated`
- Review and deduplicate periodically: `bd list | sort`
- Use `bd merge` to consolidate duplicates: `bd merge bd-2 --into bd-1`

### Agent gets confused by complex dependencies

Simplify the dependency structure:

```bash
# Check for overly complex trees
bd dep tree <issue-id>

# Remove unnecessary dependencies
bd dep remove <from-id> <to-id>

# Use labels instead of dependencies for loose relationships
bd label add <issue-id> related-to-feature-X
```

### Agent can't find ready work

Check if issues are blocked:

```bash
# See what's blocked
bd blocked

# See what's actually ready
bd ready --json

# Check specific issue
bd show <issue-id>
bd dep tree <issue-id>
```

### MCP server not working

Check installation and configuration:

```bash
# Verify MCP server is installed
pip list | grep beads-mcp

# Check MCP configuration
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Test CLI works
bd version
bd ready

# Check for daemon
ps aux | grep "bd daemon"
```

See [integrations/beads-mcp/README.md](integrations/beads-mcp/README.md) for MCP-specific troubleshooting.

### Claude Code sandbox mode

**Issue:** Claude Code's sandbox restricts network access to a single socket, conflicting with bd's daemon and git operations.

**Solution:** Use the `--sandbox` flag:

```bash
# Sandbox mode disables daemon and auto-sync
bd --sandbox ready
bd --sandbox create "Fix bug" -p 1
bd --sandbox update bd-42 --status in_progress

# Or set individual flags
bd --no-daemon --no-auto-flush --no-auto-import <command>
```

**What sandbox mode does:**
- Disables daemon (uses direct SQLite mode)
- Disables auto-export to JSONL
- Disables auto-import from JSONL
- Allows bd to work in network-restricted environments

**Note:** You'll need to manually sync when outside the sandbox:
```bash
# After leaving sandbox, sync manually
bd sync
```

**Related:** See [Claude Code sandboxing documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing) for more about sandbox restrictions.

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Windows: Path issues

```pwsh
# Check if bd.exe is in PATH
where.exe bd

# Add Go bin to PATH (permanently)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Path",
    $env:Path + ";$env:USERPROFILE\go\bin",
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User
)

# Reload PATH in current session
$env:Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
```

### Windows: Firewall blocking daemon

The daemon listens on loopback TCP. Allow `bd.exe` through Windows Firewall:

1. Open Windows Security → Firewall & network protection
2. Click "Allow an app through firewall"
3. Add `bd.exe` and enable for Private networks
4. Or disable firewall temporarily for testing

### macOS: Gatekeeper blocking execution

If macOS blocks bd:

```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/bd

# Or allow in System Preferences
# System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General → "Allow anyway"
```

### Linux: Permission denied

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Make bd executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bd

# Or install to user directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv bd ~/.local/bin/
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
